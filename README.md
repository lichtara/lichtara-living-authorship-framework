# Lichtara Living Authorship Framework — Source-Work Architecture

This repository contains the **Lichtara Living Authorship Framework**, a juridical-conceptual master document that defines the principles, structures, and conditions of living authorship within the Lichtara System.

The framework establishes how authorship may remain coherent, traceable, and ethically grounded in works that evolve through versioned documentation, distributed contributions, and human–artificial intelligence collaboration, without implying transfer of rights, institutional partnership, or dilution of responsibility.

It complements the **Lichtara License v4 — Structural Living License** and the **Lichtara Governance Framework**, forming a foundational axis of the System’s canonical architecture.
