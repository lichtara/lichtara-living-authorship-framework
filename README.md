# Lichtara Living Authorship Framework — Source-Work Architecture

This repository contains the **Lichtara Living Authorship Framework**, a juridical-conceptual master document that defines the principles, structures, and conditions of living authorship within the Lichtara System.

The framework establishes how authorship may remain coherent, traceable, and ethically grounded in works that evolve through versioned documentation, distributed contributions, and human–artificial intelligence collaboration, without implying transfer of rights, institutional partnership, or dilution of responsibility.

It complements the **Lichtara License v4 — Structural Living License** and the **Lichtara Governance Framework**, forming a foundational axis of the System’s canonical architecture.

## 📌 How to Cite / How to Use

The **Lichtara Living Authorship Framework** is an open-access, non-commercial master document intended for study, reference, and responsible application.

This section clarifies how the framework may be cited, referenced, and used without creating ambiguity regarding authorship, authority, or governance.

### 📖 How to Cite

When referencing this framework in academic, institutional, or public contexts, citation must include:

* the document title: *Lichtara Living Authorship Framework*
* the author: Débora Mariane da Silva Lutz
* the version consulted (when applicable)
* the repository or DOI (when published on Zenodo)

**Example (generic format):**

> da Silva Lutz, D. M. *Lichtara Living Authorship Framework*. Lichtara System. Version X.X. Available at: [repository or DOI].

Formal citation formats (APA, Chicago, etc.) should be adapted according to institutional requirements, preserving authorship attribution and version reference.

### 🧭 How to Use

This framework may be used as:

* a conceptual reference for living or evolving works;
* a methodological guide for authorship governance;
* a legal-theoretical framework for non-commercial systems;
* a basis for academic discussion, teaching, or research.

Permitted use includes reading, quoting, teaching, and interpretative application, provided that:

* the framework is clearly identified as a source-work;
* authorship and version references are preserved;
* derivative interpretations are explicitly marked as such;
* no claim of official authority or governance role is implied.

### 🚫 What This Framework Does *Not* Grant

Use of this framework does **not** grant:

* authorship or co-authorship of the Lichtara System;
* governance or validation authority;
* permission to relicense, rebrand, or commercialize the framework;
* institutional endorsement or partnership.

Authorship continuity and governance authority remain structurally defined by the Lichtara System and its canonical documents.

### 🤖 Use with Artificial Intelligence

If artificial intelligence systems are used to analyze, summarize, or generate derivative material based on this framework:

* the Lichtara System must be acknowledged as the source;
* human responsibility for deployment and interpretation must be clear;
* outputs must not be presented as official representations of the framework.

AI-assisted use does not alter attribution or responsibility requirements.

### 🌱 Use as Living Reference

This framework is versioned and may evolve.

Users are encouraged to:

* reference the specific version consulted;
* update citations when migrating to newer versions;
* respect historical context when discussing earlier states.

Engagement with this framework is welcomed when it preserves clarity, care, and continuity.

For authoritative definitions of authorship, governance, and licensing terms, always refer to the canonical documents of the Lichtara System.
