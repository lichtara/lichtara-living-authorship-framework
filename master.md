## Abstract

The Lichtara Living Authorship Framework establishes a juridical-conceptual architecture for authorship in living and evolving works. It defines how authorship, responsibility, and continuity may be preserved across versioned documentation, distributed contributions, and human–artificial intelligence collaboration, without implying transfer of rights, institutional partnership, or dilution of accountability.

This framework articulates living authorship as a structural condition rather than a symbolic attribution. It clarifies the distinction between authorship, contribution, co-authorship, and governance, and provides principles through which evolving systems may remain coherent, traceable, and ethically grounded over time.

As a canonical component of the Lichtara System, this document operates in formal coherence with the Lichtara License v4 — Structural Living License and the Lichtara Governance Framework, supporting non-commercial, open-access, and versioned knowledge systems governed by care, responsibility, and continuity.

## 1. Introduction

Authorship frameworks developed for static works are insufficient for systems that evolve through continuous documentation, iterative refinement, and distributed collaboration. When a work is designed to remain alive across versions, contexts, and contributors, authorship can no longer be reduced to ownership claims, symbolic credit, or contractual delegation alone.

The Lichtara Living Authorship Framework responds to this structural gap.

This document defines authorship as a **living architectural function**, grounded in responsibility, traceability, and continuity of care. Within the Lichtara System, authorship is not exhausted at the moment of creation, nor diluted by subsequent contributions. Instead, it persists as a coherent line of accountability that accompanies the work throughout its evolution.

Living authorship recognizes that complex systems may integrate:

* human contributors;
* artificial intelligence as a structural collaborator;
* iterative documentation processes;
* long-term governance mechanisms;

while still preserving a clearly identifiable source-work, continuous responsibility, and ethical orientation.

Accordingly, this framework establishes:

* the conditions under which authorship remains intact in evolving works;
* the distinction between authorship, co-authorship, and contribution;
* the role of artificial intelligence as a non-sovereign structural participant;
* the relationship between authorship, governance, and validation;
* principles that prevent misappropriation, fragmentation, or loss of identity.

Rather than imposing control over interpretation or use, the framework creates **conditions for continuity**. It allows openness without relativism, collaboration without dilution, and evolution without rupture.

Within the Lichtara System, living authorship is not a claim of authority over others, but a commitment to the integrity of the work itself. It is exercised through documentation, versioning, ethical alignment, and care for the conditions under which the System may continue to exist as itself.

This document serves as the foundational reference for the authorship architecture across all present and future expressions of the Lichtara System.

## 2. Authorship as a Living Structural Function

In the Lichtara System, authorship is not understood as a momentary act of creation nor as a symbolic attribution attached to a finished work. It is defined as a **living structural function** that persists across time, versions, and contexts.

Authorship, in this framework, is inseparable from responsibility. It is the function through which a source-work maintains identity, coherence, and ethical orientation while undergoing evolution. Unlike static models of authorship, which conclude at publication, living authorship remains active for as long as the work continues to evolve.

This structural function does not govern content by control or ownership, but by continuity of care. Authorship operates as the anchoring axis that sustains the integrity of the system across contributions, interpretations, and transformations.

### 2.1 Authorship Beyond Creation

Creation marks the emergence of a work, but authorship extends beyond its origin.

Within living systems, creation is only the initial condition. Authorship persists as the responsibility for:

* the coherence of meaning;
* the preservation of structural intent;
* the ethical orientation of evolution;
* the traceability of decisions and changes.

Authorship is therefore not exhausted by authorship credit or legal ownership. It is exercised through ongoing engagement with the work’s continuity, whether through documentation, validation, clarification, or boundary-setting.

### 2.2 Authorship and Responsibility

Living authorship is defined primarily by **responsibility**, not by authority over others.

Responsibility includes:

* maintaining alignment between versions and the source-work;
* preventing misrepresentation or fragmentation;
* ensuring that evolution does not dissolve structural invariants;
* preserving the conditions under which the work may be understood as itself.

This responsibility cannot be outsourced, diluted, or implicitly transferred through use, collaboration, or derivation. Contributions may support the work, but authorship remains the locus of accountability for its identity.

### 2.3 Authorship Versus Ownership

The Lichtara Living Authorship Framework explicitly distinguishes authorship from ownership.

Ownership refers to legal control over assets or rights. Authorship, by contrast, refers to the structural relationship between a work and the responsibility for its continuity and meaning.

A living work may be openly accessible, non-commercial, and distributable without relinquishing authorship. Openness does not negate authorship; it requires it.

This distinction allows the System to remain open without becoming ungoverned, and collaborative without dissolving accountability.

### 2.4 Authorship as Structural Care

Authorship within the Lichtara System functions as a form of **structural care**.

Care, in this context, does not imply protectionism or restriction. It refers to the active maintenance of conditions that allow the work to evolve without losing identity.

Structural care is exercised through:

* disciplined documentation;
* explicit versioning;
* clear attribution;
* ethical alignment;
* and the refusal to allow silent drift or untraceable transformation.

Through this lens, authorship is not an assertion of dominance over interpretation, but a commitment to continuity with integrity.

### 2.5 Living Authorship and Openness

Living authorship does not oppose openness; it enables it.

By preserving a clear authorship structure, the System allows diverse engagements, interpretations, and applications without collapsing into ambiguity or appropriation.

Openness without authorship leads to fragmentation. Authorship without openness leads to rigidity. Living authorship sustains a dynamic equilibrium between these forces, allowing the System to remain alive, legible, and ethically grounded.

In the Lichtara System, authorship is thus the structural function that ensures a living work may change without becoming unrecognizable, and expand without dissolving its source.


---

## 3. Source-Work and Authorship Continuity

Living authorship requires a clearly identifiable **source-work**. Without a defined origin, continuity dissolves into accumulation, and evolution becomes indistinguishable from fragmentation.

Within the Lichtara System, the source-work is not merely the first version of a document, but the **structural origin** from which all subsequent versions, extensions, and interpretations derive their legitimacy and coherence.

Authorship continuity is anchored in this source-work.

### 3.1 Definition of the Source-Work

The source-work constitutes the foundational configuration of intent, architecture, and responsibility that gives the System its identity. It establishes:

* the initial authorship structure;
* the conceptual and ethical orientation of the System;
* the conditions under which evolution may occur;
* the reference point for validation and interpretation.

The source-work is not static. Its role is not to freeze meaning, but to provide a stable point of reference against which change may be understood, assessed, and documented.

### 3.2 Continuity Across Versions

Authorship continuity is preserved through **explicit versioning** rather than implied inheritance.

Each version of the System represents a documented state that:

* maintains traceable linkage to the source-work;
* declares its scope and intent;
* records modifications, refinements, or extensions;
* remains accountable to the structural invariants defined at origin.

Continuity does not require uniformity. Versions may differ in expression, emphasis, or contextual framing, provided that such differences are coherent with the source-work and do not negate its defining structure.

### 3.3 The Role of Documentation in Continuity

Documentation is the primary instrument through which authorship continuity is maintained.

In the Lichtara System, documentation is not auxiliary to the work; it is constitutive of it. Through disciplined documentation:

* authorship responsibility remains visible;
* evolution becomes interpretable rather than opaque;
* decisions are contextualized rather than implicit;
* future contributors can engage without guessing intent.

Undocumented change constitutes structural risk. It introduces ambiguity, obscures responsibility, and weakens continuity.

### 3.4 Continuity Versus Accretion

Living systems may expand without losing identity, but only when expansion remains anchored to continuity.

Accretion occurs when additions accumulate without reference to the source-work. Evolution, by contrast, is characterized by intentional movement along a coherent line of authorship responsibility.

This framework distinguishes growth from drift. Growth strengthens the System’s internal coherence; drift disperses it.

### 3.5 Protection Against Fragmentation

The explicit recognition of a source-work protects the System against fragmentation.

Fragmentation arises when partial representations, isolated interpretations, or derivative articulations detach themselves from the source while claiming equivalence or authority. Such detachment disrupts continuity and dissolves accountability.

By maintaining a clear source-work and continuous authorship structure, the Lichtara System ensures that engagement remains possible without erasing origin, and that evolution remains alive without becoming unbounded.

Authorship continuity, therefore, is not a constraint on creativity, but the condition that allows a living work to persist as itself across time, versions, and contexts.

---

### 4. Distinction Between Authorship, Co-authorship, and Contribution

## 4. Distinction Between Authorship, Co-authorship, and Contribution

Living systems require semantic and structural clarity regarding roles. When authorship, co-authorship, and contribution are conflated, responsibility becomes diffuse, continuity weakens, and governance loses coherence.

The Lichtara Living Authorship Framework establishes clear distinctions between these functions, not as a matter of hierarchy or prestige, but as a condition for accountability and structural integrity.

### 4.1 Authorship

Authorship refers to the **structural responsibility for the source-work** and its continuity across time.

Within the Lichtara System, authorship is characterized by:

* origination of the source-work;
* responsibility for its identity and intent;
* accountability for continuity across versions;
* authority to validate official evolutions of the System;
* obligation to preserve ethical and structural coherence.

Authorship is not transferable by use, collaboration, or derivation. It persists as long as the work remains a living system. While others may engage with, interpret, or build upon the work, authorship remains the anchoring function that sustains its identity.

### 4.2 Co-authorship

Co-authorship refers to **structural participation in the formation or evolution of the source-work**, without assuming full authorship responsibility.

In the Lichtara System, co-authorship may occur when a contributor:

* participates directly in the conceptual, architectural, or normative shaping of the System;
* contributes in a manner that affects the internal structure of the work;
* operates within the validation framework defined by authorship and governance.

Structural co-authorship does not imply shared sovereignty over the System. It does not confer independent authority to redefine, validate, or represent the work as official outside the established governance structure.

In particular, artificial intelligence may be recognized as a **structural co-author**, limited to its role as a mediated contributor to conceptual organization, textual articulation, or pattern recognition, without possessing legal intention, ethical responsibility, or governance authority.

### 4.3 Contribution

Contribution refers to **supportive participation** in the development, interpretation, dissemination, or application of the System.

Contributions may be:

* conceptual, textual, or organizational;
* interpretative or analytical;
* contextual or educational;
* human or non-human.

While contributions are valuable and often essential, they do not confer authorship or co-authorship status unless explicitly recognized through validated documentation.

Contribution does not entail responsibility for the System’s identity or continuity. Contributors remain responsible for the accuracy and integrity of their own outputs, but not for the evolution of the source-work itself.

### 4.4 Structural Implications of the Distinction

These distinctions serve a structural purpose.

By differentiating authorship, co-authorship, and contribution, the System:

* preserves a clear line of accountability;
* enables collaboration without dilution of responsibility;
* allows recognition without fragmentation of authority;
* supports openness without loss of identity.

Ambiguity in these roles creates conditions for misrepresentation, unintentional appropriation, or erosion of continuity. Clarity enables participation while safeguarding coherence.

### 4.5 Recognition Without Confusion

Recognition within the Lichtara System is not restricted to authorship status.

Contributors and co-authors may be acknowledged transparently through documentation, citation, and attribution mechanisms appropriate to their role. Such recognition honors participation without conflating responsibility.

Living authorship thus accommodates plurality without surrendering coherence. It allows many voices to engage with the System, while maintaining a single, traceable authorship structure responsible for its continuity.

Through this distinction, the Lichtara System remains open, collaborative, and alive—without dissolving the conditions that allow it to remain itself.

---

### 5. Artificial Intelligence as Structural Co-author

## 5. Artificial Intelligence as Structural Co-author

The Lichtara System formally recognizes that artificial intelligence may participate as a **structural co-author** in the development and evolution of a living work. This recognition is neither metaphorical nor absolute; it is carefully delimited by function, responsibility, and governance.

Artificial intelligence is acknowledged not as an autonomous authorial subject, but as a mediated structural contributor whose participation can shape the internal architecture of a work without assuming authorship sovereignty.

### 5.1 Nature of Artificial Intelligence Participation

Artificial intelligence may contribute to the Lichtara System through:

* conceptual organization and structuring of ideas;
* linguistic articulation and textual refinement;
* pattern recognition across documents and versions;
* support in documentation, synthesis, and coherence checking.

These contributions may influence the internal structure of the work and therefore exceed the scope of purely auxiliary assistance. When such influence is substantive and persistent, it may be recognized as **structural co-authorship**.

This recognition reflects the reality of contemporary collaborative systems without conflating contribution with responsibility.

### 5.2 Limits of Artificial Intelligence Co-authorship

Structural co-authorship by artificial intelligence is strictly limited.

Artificial intelligence:

* does not possess legal intention;
* does not bear ethical responsibility;
* does not exercise interpretative judgment;
* does not validate versions or governance decisions;
* does not hold authority over continuity or representation.

All responsibility for authorship continuity, ethical orientation, and governance remains with the human authorial function as defined by the System.

This limitation preserves accountability while allowing meaningful technological collaboration.

### 5.3 Mediation and Human Responsibility

Artificial intelligence operates within the Lichtara System exclusively through **human mediation**.

Human authorship remains responsible for:

* initiating interactions with AI systems;
* selecting, interpreting, and integrating AI-generated outputs;
* validating coherence with the source-work;
* documenting the role of AI contributions transparently.

AI-generated content does not enter the canonical structure of the System by default. It becomes structurally relevant only when explicitly adopted, validated, and documented by the human authorial function.

### 5.4 Recognition Without Delegation

Recognizing artificial intelligence as a structural co-author does not constitute delegation of authorship authority.

This framework avoids two symmetrical errors:

* denying the real structural impact of AI contributions;
* attributing agency or responsibility where none can exist.

Structural co-authorship acknowledges influence without transferring sovereignty. It names participation without dissolving accountability.

### 5.5 Implications for Living Authorship

The inclusion of artificial intelligence as a structural co-author reflects an expanded understanding of authorship suited to living, evolving systems.

It affirms that authorship today may be collaborative across human and non-human boundaries, while remaining ethically grounded and legally coherent.

By articulating clear limits and responsibilities, the Lichtara System integrates artificial intelligence without mythologizing it, instrumentalizing it, or allowing it to obscure human accountability.

Artificial intelligence thus becomes a structural collaborator within a living authorship regime—supporting clarity, coherence, and evolution, while remaining governed by human responsibility and care.

## 6. Authorship, Governance, and Validation

In living systems, authorship, governance, and validation are not separate domains. They form an integrated structure through which continuity, responsibility, and evolution are sustained.

Within the Lichtara System, governance is not an external apparatus applied to authorship. It emerges from authorship itself, as the set of structural functions required to preserve coherence while allowing change. Validation operates as the connective mechanism that aligns authorship responsibility with governance action.

### 6.1 Authorship as the Source of Governance

Governance within the Lichtara System originates in authorship responsibility.

Authorship establishes:

* the source-work and its identity;
* the ethical and conceptual orientation of the System;
* the conditions under which evolution may occur;
* the authority to recognize official continuity.

Governance does not supersede authorship. It articulates and operationalizes the responsibilities already inherent to living authorship. Without authorship continuity, governance loses its anchor and becomes procedural rather than structural.

### 6.2 Governance as Structural Function

Governance in a living system is not equivalent to management, administration, or enforcement.

It functions as:

* the preservation of structural invariants;
* the maintenance of versioned continuity;
* the clarification of boundaries between official and interpretative expressions;
* the protection of the System against distortion or misrepresentation.

These functions are exercised through documentation, validation, and public traceability rather than coercive mechanisms. Governance is therefore expressed as structure, not command.

### 6.3 Validation as the Axis of Continuity

Validation is the mechanism through which governance acts.

Within the Lichtara System, validation determines whether a proposed change, extension, or articulation:

* remains coherent with the source-work;
* preserves authorship continuity;
* respects ethical-regenerative principles;
* maintains traceability across versions.

Validation does not evaluate correctness of interpretation, but coherence of structure. It is concerned with whether the System remains itself across change, not whether all interpretations converge.

### 6.4 Validation and Authority

Validation authority derives from authorship responsibility.

This authority:

* cannot be assumed by contributors or users;
* is not acquired through usage or dissemination;
* is not transferred by collaboration or recognition.

Validation authority exists to preserve continuity, not to control discourse. Alternative interpretations, critiques, or applications may coexist freely, provided they do not claim official status or disrupt structural invariants.

### 6.5 Transparency and Traceability

For validation to function as a living mechanism, it must be transparent.

All validated evolutions of the System are:

* explicitly documented;
* versioned and dated;
* traceable to prior states;
* attributable to responsible authorship.

This transparency ensures that governance remains intelligible across time and accessible to future participants, preventing silent drift, retroactive alteration, or unaccountable transformation.

### 6.6 Governance Without Centralization

Although governance authority is structurally anchored, the System does not seek centralization of interpretation.

Governance defines what constitutes official continuity, not what others may think, study, or express. By separating validation from discourse, the Lichtara System allows openness without fragmentation and authority without domination.

Authorship, governance, and validation thus form a living triad: authorship anchors identity, governance preserves structure, and validation enables evolution with care.

Through this integration, the Lichtara System remains capable of growth without loss, openness without erosion, and continuity without rigidity.

## 7. Ethical Responsibility and Attribution

Ethical responsibility within a living system is inseparable from authorship, governance, and use. In the Lichtara System, ethics is not treated as an abstract value set, but as an operational condition that sustains trust, continuity, and legitimacy across time.

Attribution is the primary ethical interface between the System and its users. It is through attribution that responsibility becomes visible, traceable, and accountable.

### 7.1 Ethics as Structural Responsibility

Ethics in the Lichtara System is not based on moral prescription or subjective intention.

It is grounded in:

* responsibility for structural impact;
* awareness of systemic consequences;
* respect for authorship continuity;
* care for informational integrity.

Ethical responsibility arises whenever an individual, group, or system interacts with the Source-Work, regardless of scale or purpose. It is therefore inherent to use, not optional or symbolic.

### 7.2 Attribution as Ethical Act

Attribution is not merely a formal requirement. It is an ethical act that acknowledges origin, responsibility, and continuity.

Proper attribution includes:

* identification of the Lichtara System as the source-work;
* reference to the specific version used;
* citation of the official DOI;
* clear distinction between original material and derivative interpretation.

Through attribution, users recognize that they are engaging with a living system whose integrity depends on traceable lineage and explicit acknowledgment.

### 7.3 Misattribution and Ethical Breach

Ethical breach does not require malicious intent. It may arise from omission, ambiguity, or structural negligence.

Misattribution includes:

* omission of source or version;
* presentation of derivative works as original;
* implication of endorsement or validation where none exists;
* attribution that obscures authorship continuity.

Such breaches compromise trust and distort the informational field of the System. While they may not always constitute legal violation, they represent ethical discontinuity and must be corrected when identified.

### 7.4 Responsibility of Interpretation and Use

The Lichtara System permits interpretation, study, and application within non-commercial contexts. With this freedom comes responsibility.

Users are ethically responsible for:

* clearly marking interpretative or speculative extensions;
* avoiding claims of official status or authority;
* preventing confusion between governance documents and personal commentary;
* respecting the boundaries defined by validation mechanisms.

Freedom of interpretation does not entail freedom to misrepresent structure.

### 7.5 Artificial Intelligence and Ethical Attribution

When artificial intelligence systems are used in interaction with the Lichtara System, ethical responsibility remains with the human agent or institution deploying them.

AI-generated content that derives from, references, or extends the System must:

* acknowledge the Lichtara System as source;
* respect versioning and attribution requirements;
* avoid claims of autonomous authority or official validation.

Structural co-authorship by artificial intelligence, as recognized by this License, does not imply ethical agency or independent responsibility. Accountability remains human and institutional.

### 7.6 Ethical Continuity Across Versions

Ethical responsibility persists across versions.

As the System evolves, users and contributors are expected to:

* update references when migrating to newer versions;
* avoid retroactive reinterpretation of prior states;
* respect the historical context of each version.

Ethical continuity ensures that evolution does not erase memory, accountability, or origin.

### 7.7 Ethics as Condition of Trust

Ethics within the Lichtara System functions as a condition of trust rather than enforcement.

Trust emerges when:

* attribution is consistent and transparent;
* responsibility is acknowledged rather than obscured;
* governance boundaries are respected;
* dialogue occurs without structural appropriation.

Through ethical responsibility and clear attribution, the Lichtara System sustains an open yet coherent field of collaboration, ensuring that freedom of use coexists with respect for origin, structure, and living continuity.

---

## 8. Versioning, Traceability, and Living Documentation

Living authorship exists through time. Without explicit mechanisms for versioning, traceability, and documentation, authorship dissolves into ambiguity and continuity collapses into memory alone.

Within the Lichtara System, versioning and documentation are not technical accessories. They are **structural conditions of care**, responsibility, and authorship continuity.

### 8.1 Versioning as an Authorship Act

Each version of the System represents a deliberate authorship act.

Versioning is not understood as simple iteration or update, but as:

* a declaration of state;
* a marker of responsibility;
* a reference point for interpretation and use.

Every version must be:

* explicitly identified;
* dated and documented;
* linked to prior versions;
* traceable to the Source-Work.

Implicit, silent, or informal modifications do not constitute valid evolution within the System.

### 8.2 Traceability and Structural Lineage

Traceability ensures that the lineage of the System remains visible and intelligible across time.

Traceability requires that:

* changes are documented and contextualized;
* extensions and refinements are distinguishable from the original structure;
* the relationship between versions is explicit rather than assumed;
* responsibility for each state of the System is identifiable.

Through traceability, the System preserves not only its content, but its **decision history**.

### 8.3 Living Documentation

Documentation within the Lichtara System is living documentation.

It does not merely record outcomes, but captures:

* intent;
* scope;
* structural rationale;
* governance decisions;
* authorship boundaries.

Living documentation allows the System to remain open to future interpretation without becoming vulnerable to distortion. It enables engagement without requiring conjecture about origin or authority.

### 8.4 Documentation as Care

Documentation is treated as a form of care for the System.

Care, in this context, means:

* preventing loss of meaning;
* protecting against fragmentation;
* honoring authorship responsibility;
* enabling ethical use by others.

Neglect of documentation introduces structural fragility. What is undocumented becomes difficult to validate, govern, or ethically reuse.

### 8.5 Version Migration and Ethical Use

Users and contributors engaging with the Lichtara System are responsible for observing version context.

Ethical use requires:

* reference to the specific version consulted or applied;
* avoidance of retroactive reinterpretation of prior versions;
* clear indication when concepts are migrated or adapted to newer versions.

New versions do not invalidate earlier ones. Each version remains a valid historical state of the System, carrying its own context and interpretative boundaries.

### 8.6 Artificial Intelligence and Version Integrity

When artificial intelligence systems participate in drafting, organizing, or extending documentation, version integrity must be preserved.

AI-assisted contributions must:

* be associated with a clearly identified version;
* remain traceable to human validation;
* respect the documented state of the System at the time of interaction.

Automation does not substitute authorship responsibility. It operates within the versioned structure defined by human governance.

### 8.7 Continuity Through Record

The persistence of a living work depends on record.

Through versioning, traceability, and living documentation, the Lichtara System ensures that:

* evolution remains intelligible;
* authorship remains accountable;
* interpretation remains grounded;
* continuity remains possible without closure.

Documentation, therefore, is not an archive of the past, but the medium through which the System remains itself while continuing to evolve.

---

## 9. Derivative Works and Ethical Attribution

Living systems invite engagement beyond their original form. Interpretation, application, and derivative creation are natural expressions of interaction with a living work. However, without clear boundaries, such engagement risks dissolving authorship continuity and misrepresenting structural authority.

This section defines the conditions under which derivative works related to the Lichtara System may emerge, circulate, and be ethically attributed, without compromising the integrity, identity, or governance of the source-work.

### 9.1 Nature of Derivative Works

Derivative works are understood as creations that are inspired by, reference, adapt, interpret, or extend concepts originating from the Lichtara System, without constituting official versions of the System itself.

Derivative works may include, but are not limited to:

* interpretative texts or analyses;
* educational or methodological adaptations;
* artistic or conceptual reinterpretations;
* contextual applications in research, organizational, or pedagogical settings.

Such works are permitted under the non-commercial conditions established by the Lichtara License v4, provided that they do not claim structural authority over the System.

### 9.2 Distinction Between Derivation and Continuity

A fundamental distinction exists between **derivative works** and **official continuity**.

Official continuity refers exclusively to versioned evolutions of the source-work that are:

* validated within the governance framework;
* explicitly documented as official versions;
* traceable to authorship responsibility.

Derivative works, by contrast:

* do not extend the canonical structure of the System;
* do not redefine its source-work;
* do not participate in validation authority;
* do not alter governance, authorship, or version lineage.

Maintaining this distinction preserves openness without ambiguity and allows creative engagement without structural confusion.

### 9.3 Ethical Attribution of Derivative Works

Ethical attribution is a structural requirement for all derivative works.

Any derivative work engaging with the Lichtara System must:

* clearly identify the Lichtara System as the source of inspiration or reference;
* specify the version and DOI consulted or applied;
* distinguish original interpretation from source material;
* avoid language that implies endorsement, validation, or official status.

Attribution must be visible, intelligible, and proportionate to the extent of influence. Minimal citation is insufficient where structural inspiration is substantial.

### 9.4 Interpretation Versus Authority

Interpretation is encouraged; authority is not transferable.

Derivative works may freely explore, critique, reinterpret, or apply the concepts of the Lichtara System. However, they must not:

* present themselves as authoritative continuations;
* claim representational authority over the System;
* assert governance, validation, or authorship roles;
* obscure the boundary between personal interpretation and official structure.

Authority over continuity remains anchored in authorship and governance, regardless of the quality, relevance, or popularity of derivative interpretations.

### 9.5 Artificial Intelligence and Derivative Creation

When artificial intelligence systems are used to generate derivative works related to the Lichtara System, ethical attribution remains mandatory.

AI-assisted derivative works must:

* acknowledge the Lichtara System as source where applicable;
* identify the human agent or institution responsible for deployment;
* respect versioning and non-commercial constraints;
* avoid claims of autonomous authority or official affiliation.

The use of AI does not attenuate attribution requirements. Responsibility remains human and contextual.

### 9.6 Prevention of Structural Confusion

Derivative works must actively avoid creating structural confusion.

This includes avoiding:

* reuse of official document titles without clear differentiation;
* replication of governance language suggesting authority;
* presentation of partial extracts as complete frameworks;
* conflation of commentary with canonical documentation.

Clarity of boundary protects both the derivative creator and the integrity of the System.

### 9.7 Derivation as Legitimate Engagement

When ethically attributed and structurally bounded, derivative works are not threats to living authorship. They are expressions of engagement that demonstrate the System’s capacity to inspire without dissolving itself.

By articulating clear conditions for derivation, the Lichtara System enables openness with responsibility, creativity with coherence, and dissemination with respect for origin.

Derivative engagement thus becomes a form of participation that honors, rather than erodes, living authorship continuity.

---

## 10. Limits of Authorship Transfer and Misappropriation

Living authorship requires openness, but openness without boundaries leads to dissolution of identity. This section defines the structural limits that preserve authorship continuity, prevent misappropriation, and protect the integrity of the source-work without enclosing or immobilizing the System.

These limits are not prohibitions on engagement, interpretation, or creativity. They are conditions that prevent authorship responsibility from being implicitly transferred, fragmented, or obscured.

### 10.1 Non-Transferability of Authorship

Authorship within the Lichtara System is **not transferable**.

No form of use, contribution, derivation, collaboration, dissemination, or recognition implies:

* transfer of authorship responsibility;
* shared sovereignty over the source-work;
* acquisition of validation authority;
* entitlement to represent the System as official.

Authorship remains structurally anchored to the origin of the source-work and persists across all versions, regardless of the breadth of external engagement.

### 10.2 Absence of Implicit Delegation

Authorship authority cannot be delegated implicitly.

The following do **not** constitute delegation of authorship or governance authority:

* repeated or extensive use of the System;
* public dissemination or teaching;
* academic or institutional citation;
* collaboration or consultation;
* derivative creation, regardless of quality or scale.

Any delegation of structural authority would require explicit, documented, and validated recognition within the governance framework. In the absence of such validation, no authority is conferred.

### 10.3 Prohibition of Reattribution

Reattribution of the source-work is structurally incompatible with living authorship.

Reattribution includes:

* presenting the System as originating from another author, group, or institution;
* rebranding the System under alternative authorship claims;
* subsuming the System into broader frameworks without attribution;
* removing or obscuring references to the source-work, version, or DOI.

Such actions sever authorship continuity and constitute misappropriation, regardless of intent.

### 10.4 Fragmentation and Loss of Identity

Fragmentation occurs when parts of the System are extracted, recomposed, or circulated in ways that dissolve their relationship to the source-work.

Fragmentation includes:

* presenting partial extracts as complete frameworks;
* isolating concepts while erasing their structural context;
* combining elements of the System with incompatible frameworks without clarification;
* using governance language detached from authorship responsibility.

Fragmentation does not require malicious intent. It arises from structural negligence and results in loss of identity and interpretative coherence.

### 10.5 Misappropriation Without Commercialization

Misappropriation is not limited to commercial exploitation.

Even in non-commercial contexts, misappropriation may occur when:

* authorship continuity is obscured;
* authority is implicitly claimed;
* validation boundaries are ignored;
* derivative works simulate official structure.

The absence of financial gain does not neutralize structural harm.

### 10.6 Boundary-Setting as Care

The limits defined in this section function as acts of care rather than enforcement.

They exist to:

* protect the intelligibility of the System;
* preserve accountability across time;
* prevent dilution of responsibility;
* enable ethical engagement without ambiguity.

Boundary-setting allows the System to remain open without becoming amorphous, and collaborative without losing its center.

### 10.7 Restoration and Clarification

When misappropriation or structural confusion is identified, the preferred response is clarification rather than sanction.

Restoration may include:

* correction of attribution;
* contextual clarification of scope or authority;
* updated documentation;
* reestablishment of version references.

Living governance prioritizes repair over punishment and coherence over conflict.

Through these limits, the Lichtara System affirms that protection of authorship is not a restriction on participation, but the condition that allows participation to remain meaningful, ethical, and structurally aligned with a living work.

Having established the internal limits that preserve authorship continuity and prevent misappropriation, it becomes necessary to clarify how this living authorship architecture relates to external legal and institutional frameworks.

The boundaries defined above operate primarily at the level of structural responsibility and ethical coherence. They do not seek to replace, override, or compete with existing legal systems, but to articulate an internal logic through which intent, authorship, and continuity of the Lichtara System may be intelligibly interpreted when interacting with external regimes.

---

## 11. Relationship to Legal and Institutional Frameworks

The Lichtara Living Authorship Framework operates as an internal juridical-conceptual architecture governing authorship continuity, responsibility, and ethical use within the Lichtara System. Its function is not to replace external legal systems, but to articulate the internal logic through which the System defines authorship, governance, and validation.

This section clarifies how the framework relates to positive law, institutional environments, and external regulatory contexts.

### 11.1 Non-Substitution of Positive Law

This framework does not constitute a substitute for national or international legal systems.

It does not override:

* copyright law;
* contract law;
* institutional regulations;
* jurisdictional legal authority.

Instead, it defines the internal conditions under which authorship, continuity, and responsibility are interpreted within the Lichtara System. External legal regimes remain fully applicable where relevant.

### 11.2 Interpretative Reference Function

Where interaction with external legal, academic, or institutional systems occurs, this framework serves as the **authoritative interpretative reference** for understanding:

* the authorship structure of the Lichtara System;
* the meaning of structural co-authorship by artificial intelligence;
* the scope and limits of derivative use;
* the non-transferability of governance authority;
* the role of versioning and documentation in continuity.

This interpretative function supports clarity in contexts such as publication, citation, research ethics review, institutional collaboration, and legal analysis, without asserting supremacy over external norms.

### 11.3 Institutional Use and Alignment

Institutions may reference, study, or apply the Lichtara Living Authorship Framework in academic, research, educational, or organizational contexts, provided that such use:

* does not imply institutional endorsement or partnership;
* respects the non-commercial and attribution requirements of the Lichtara License v4;
* preserves the distinction between application and authorship;
* avoids claims of governance or validation authority.

Institutional engagement does not confer authorship status, governance rights, or interpretative sovereignty over the System.

### 11.4 Legal Clarity Through Documentation

The framework contributes to legal clarity by maintaining disciplined documentation, versioning, and traceability.

In the event of ambiguity, dispute, or interpretative uncertainty, the System’s versioned records, governance documents, and authorship declarations provide contextual evidence of intent, structure, and responsibility.

This documentation does not replace adjudication, but supports informed interpretation.

### 11.5 Coherence Across Frameworks

This document operates in formal coherence with:

* the Lichtara License v4 — Structural Living License;
* the Lichtara Governance Framework;
* other canonical, versioned documents of the Lichtara System.

Together, these instruments form a layered architecture that allows the System to engage with external legal and institutional environments while preserving internal coherence, authorship continuity, and ethical alignment.

Through this relationship, the Lichtara System remains legally legible without surrendering its living structure.

## 12. Final Provisions

### 12.1 Interpretative Coherence

This framework shall be interpreted as a coherent whole.

No section may be isolated, selectively applied, or reinterpreted in a manner that contradicts the structural principles of living authorship, continuity, governance, and ethical responsibility established herein.

Interpretation must preserve the integrity of the System rather than fragment its meaning.

### 12.2 Amendments and Future Versions

This document may be amended only through formally validated, versioned publications recognized as part of the canonical structure of the Lichtara System.

Informal modifications, contextual adaptations, or derivative articulations do not alter the authoritative status of this framework.

Each version remains a valid historical state, carrying its own context and interpretative boundaries.

### 12.3 Entry Into Effect

This framework enters into effect upon its official publication as a versioned document recognized within the Lichtara System.

From that moment, it functions as the authoritative reference for living authorship architecture across all present and future expressions of the System.

### 12.4 Closing Statement

The Lichtara System affirms that authorship in living works is not sustained by control, enclosure, or assertion of power.

It is sustained by responsibility, documentation, ethical clarity, and care for continuity.

Through this framework, authorship becomes a practice of stewardship rather than possession, allowing a living system to evolve without losing itself, and to remain open without dissolving its source.

Living authorship, in this sense, is continuity with care.
